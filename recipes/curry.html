    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 200°C/400°F/gas 6.</li>
        <li>Roughly chop some of the mushrooms, keeping the smaller ones whole and tearing up the rest. Tip into a large casserole dish and toast on the hob over a medium heat for 5 to 8 minutes, until nutty and really golden.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, peel and finely slice the garlic, ginger and onion. Trim and finely slice the chilli, then roughly chop the tomatoes.</li>
        <li>Add all of it to the pan except the tomatoes, then add 1 tablespoon of oil and the spices. Toss for 2 minutes, or until the spices are toasted and it’s smelling lovely, stirring continuously.</li>
        <li>Add the tomatoes, mango chutney and coconut milk, stir to combine and season well with sea salt and black pepper.</li>
        <li>Top with bits of the paneer and place in the oven. Cook for 30 minutes, or until all cooked through and gnarly.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, cook the rice according to the packet instructions.</li>
        <li>Taste and season as required, adding a little lime juice if needed.</li>
        <li>Spoon the curry over the rice, then roughly chop the coriander leaves and scatter over the top. Cut the remaining lime into wedges for people to squeeze over the top</li>
    </ol>
