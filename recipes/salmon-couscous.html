        <li>75 g couscous</li>
        <li>1 small courgette</li>
        <li>1 handful of asparagus</li>
        <li>1 fresh red chilli</li>
        <li>2 ripe tomatoes</li>
        <li>a few springs of fresh coriander</li>
        <li>1 x 120 g salmon fillet , skin on, scaled, pin-boned, from sustainable sources</li>
        <li>extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>Â½ a lemon</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon fat-free natural yoghurt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ol>
        <li> Pop the couscous into a bowl, just cover with boiling water, put a plate on top and leave for 10 minutes to do its thing.</li>
        <li>Slice the courgette into batons, snap the woody ends from the asparagus and deseed and finely chop the chilli.</li>
        <li>Roughly chop the tomatoes, then pick and roughly chop the coriander leaves, discarding the stalks.</li>
        <li>Slice the salmon into finger-sized strips, drizzle with olive oil, then season with pepper and a small pinch of sea salt.</li>
        <li>Heat a small non-stick frying pan over a medium heat, add the salmon, then scatter over the courgette and chilli. Cook for 2 minutes, turning the salmon halfway.</li>
        <li>Stir the tomatoes, lemon juice, 1 tablespoon of oil and the chopped coriander into the couscous, then season to taste with salt and black pepper.</li>
        <li>Carefully remove the salmon strips to a plate, then add the couscous to the veg left in the pan. Toss and mix together, then place the salmon strips on top of the couscous. Cover with a lid or some tin foil and place back on a high heat for 1 final minute, or until the fish is beautifully cooked.</li>
        <li>To serve, slide everything onto a plate, spoon over the yoghurt, then tuck in.</li>
